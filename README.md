# FNOF
FNOF (Five Nights Of Filmkurs) is a game that me and my friends are working on currently, none of us have made games prior to this.
this game is about a new person to a movie school
 called "Kulturskolan" in Sweden.
 
 the player is supposed to survive as long as possible while different people are out to kill you, these people are people who work at Kulturskolan and the people who help you in the game are people who are enroled in courses.
